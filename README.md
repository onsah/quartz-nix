# Quartz Nix

Nix packaging for [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). Inspired by https://github.com/zdcthomas/quartz_flake but for non-flake Nix.

## Usage

The Nix Derivation is in `build.nix`. You need to call it with [callPackage](https://nix.dev/tutorials/callpackage.html) and with `content` which contains your notes.
